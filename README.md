## üó∫Ô∏è Repository Overview     

This repository is a growing collection of geospatial workflows, scripts, and projects organized around core themes in spatial data science. Whether you're interested in cleaning and engineering spatial data, applying machine learning, creating compelling maps, or accessing reusable geospatial methods, this repo is structured to help you quickly find what you need. Below is a breakdown of the core directories:

### üì¶ `Engineering/`     

This folder contains scripts and workflows for preprocessing and preparing geospatial data for analysis and some of the workflows I have developed. It includes operations such as reprojection, tiling, merging raster files, extracting features, cleaning shapefiles, and harmonizing attribute data across sources. Think of this as the foundation‚Äîwhere raw geographic data is transformed into analysis-ready formats.

### ü§ñ `Machine Learning/`      

Here you‚Äôll find geospatial applications of machine learning techniques. This includes notebooks and scripts for spatial prediction tasks (e.g., land cover classification, spatial interpolation), spatial cross-validation, and integration of satellite data with ground truth data.

### üß∞ `Methods/`     

The `methods` folder provides a curated set of standalone geospatial utilities and reusable scripts. These include functions for calculating area by zone, clipping rasters to administrative boundaries, reclassifying raster values, zonal statistics, and batch processing tasks across directories. These are building blocks that can be plugged into larger workflows.

### üìä `Visualization/`     

This folder houses examples and templates for visualizing spatial data. It includes both static and interactive mapping approaches using tools like `matplotlib`, `leaflet`, `folium`, `R Shiny`, and `plotly`. Expect choropleth maps, overlaid rasters and vector layers, dashboard links, animated time-series maps, and tips for customizing legends and color scales for clarity and aesthetics.
