üåç Geospatial Projects and Scripts Repository      

Welcome to my geospatial repository - a curated collection of scripts and projects that showcase various geospatial data processing and analysis concepts using tools like Google Earth Engine (GEE), R, and Python geospatial libraries. Whether you're a researcher, student, or practitioner, this repository provides working examples for common spatial analysis tasks such as satellite imagery clipping, raster processing, spatial statistics, and visualization.     

Each folder contains purpose-driven scripts tackling specific geospatial challenges, with clear documentation and reproducible workflows. The goal is to provide a hands-on reference for using open geospatial data to solve real-world problems across sectors such as, Agriculture, Urban planning, and Humanitarian work.
